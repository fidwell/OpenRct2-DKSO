# OpenRCT2 DKSO Groups

DKMP recolorable scenery groups for OpenRCT2

## What is this?

This repository contains replacement scenery groups for [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2). These scenery groups consist of all RCT1, RCT2, and expansion scenery, plus community-made recolorable versions of those objects (referred to as DKSO).

## What's so great about this version?

This particular version of DKSO uses the new .parkobj file format, which is easier for humans to read and update. Unlike the .DAT files native to RCT2, .parkobj files can be unzipped, edited, and re-released as improvements are made.

## How do I install it?

Download the workbench (.park file) from the [releases page](https://github.com/fidwell/OpenRct2-DKSO-Groups/releases). OpenRCT2 will automatically install the needed scenery groups.

## The trees, fences, and walls tabs look like they're missing items.

The built-in scenery groups for trees, fences, and walls are able to include relevant objects from other selected groups for convenience. As far as I know, custom scenery groups do not have this feature. Either you don't include any extra trees (for example) and only have them listed in the original groups, or you put _everything_ in the trees tab and pollute it with objects the user might not want.

## A custom object I want to use is missing!

Please let me know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/fidwell/OpenRct2-DKSO-Groups/issues) and I'll resolve it when I can. Make sure to include a link or attachment of the missing items.

## Can I edit the groups for personal use?

Sure. You can open any .parkobj file with a zip program like 7-Zip. The .json file inside will list all objects in the group. Simply edit the .json file and re-add it to the .parkobj. Then restart your game.

Special thanks to Iretont for creating the original DKSO workbench and spreadsheet, and most of the custom objects included in it.
